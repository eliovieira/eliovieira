### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ã‰lio, a Front-End Developer based out of Lisbon. From producing music for artists all around the world to build <Things/> on the web, I love to mix logic and minimalistic design to make user-friendly web applications.

Graduated in Information Systems, Web & Multimedia at Universidade Europeia. I'm a strong believer in self-taught programming, skilled in front-end development with a desire to learn and to grow in a collaborative team environment.

I use this Github to upload projects that I'm working on & code challenges completed by me. (codewars, codingame, hackerrank)
