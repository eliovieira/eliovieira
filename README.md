### Hey there 👋

I'm Élio, a Front-End Developer based out of Lisbon. From producing music for artists all around the world to build <Things/> on the web, I love to mix logic and minimalistic design to make user-friendly web applications.

I use this Github to upload projects that I'm working on & code challenges completed by me. (codewars, codingame, hackerrank)
